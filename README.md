# EmailSpamDetection

## Dependancy

- Python 3.10 (Does not support Python 3.11 due to Tensorflow restriant)
- Tensorflow 2.10
- Keras 2.10.0
- Numpy 1.26.4
- Pandas 2.2.1

## Data Sets

Currently, the model is trained and tested with Enron1 dataset. However, the program does accomodate different ones. To use a different dataset, load the folder to current folder, and use '''python3 fileIO.py FolderName''' to load the dataset. Then, change the name in learning.ipynb file to "data/FolderName_data.csv".

## Wordslist

Model performance relies on using proper word list. The one currently using is 5000_words. To use a different wordlist, modification to fileIO.py is required.
