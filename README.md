# EmailSpamDetection

## Dependancy

- Python 3.10 (Does not support Python 3.11 due to Tensorflow restriant)
- Tensorflow 2.10
- Keras 2.10.0
- Numpy 1.26.4
- Pandas 2.2.1

## Data Sets

Currently, the model is trained and tested with Enron1 dataset. However, the program does accomodate different ones. To use a different dataset, load the folder to current folder, and use ```python3 fileIO.py FolderName``` to load the dataset. Then, change the name in learning.ipynb file to "data/FolderName_data.csv".

## Wordslist

Model performance relies on using proper word list. The one currently using is 5000_words. To use a different wordlist, modification to fileIO.py is required.

## Results

With 20 words + engineered features, the model achieved folling results:

- MLR: accuracy 75.8% false positive rate 12.5%

- SVM: accuracy 79.6% false positive rate 23.8%

- ANN: accuracy 84.6% false positive rate 25.5%

- CNN: accuracy 74.9% false positive rate 25.0% 

With 800 words + 3 engineered features, the model achieved folling results:

- MLR: accuracy 86.7% false positive rate 7.9%

- SVM: accuracy 93.2% false positive rate 8.4%

- ANN: accuracy 95.6% false positive rate 7.7%

- CNN: accuracy 70.9% false positive rate 50.0%
