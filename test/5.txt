Colleagues, the DSI is hosting an AI Deep Dive tomorrow (Friday) at 3:00 pm on a project that is an instance of what will become an important paradigm of AI mediation between people.

Project Productive Talk, initiated through a Facebook group after the 2016 election, aims to foster productive civil discourse resulting in tangible outcomes, such as letters to leaders. The group emphasizes action-oriented dialogue, making it somewhat distinct from other civil discourse groups. An AI-mediated tool is intended to facilitate collaborative letter writing and distribution on significant issues. It intends to engage people who are concerned in/by the political divide but often deterred by confrontational discussions. Ironically, the tool may actually be rejected by some politically active partisans (but not all). This tool will leverage AI to identify common points of agreement across citizens, draft inclusive language that admits differences, and handle the logistical aspects of letter distribution to entities like government officials and organizations.
